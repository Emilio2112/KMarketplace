# Week 3

## Things I learned/did this week:

- I learned the basics of Haskell and I found the book really interesting to read. 
  I also learned more about functional programing

## Presentation Reflections:

### Fortran by Anna and Amber

#### Things I learned

- Fortran was the first high-level programming languange.
- Advantages of Fortran include that it is very optimizable, very helpful to do arithmetic and math operations!
- Fortran reduced a lot of machine code instructions to just a few statements.

#### Things that seemed confusing, incomplete or piqued my interest

- I would've like to learn more about what is FORTRAN used for nowadays. 

#### Presentation strengths/weaknesses

- Presentation was very informative.
- It was well organized and presenters were well prepared.

### LISP by Andrew and Sivhaun

#### Things I learned

- LISP, originally released in 1957, was the second high level programing language.
- Originally created as a practical mathematical notation for computer programs. Influence by the notation of Lambda calculus.
- This was the first language with "garbage collection” 

#### Things that seemed confusing, incomplete or piqued my interest

-I would've like to learn more LISP relationship to the software that we have used in Math courses like MATLAB or Maxima if any.
